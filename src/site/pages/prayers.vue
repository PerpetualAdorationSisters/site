      Prayers For The Holy Hour of Adoration
    </h2>
    <p class="my-4">
      I adore Thee at every moment, great Sacrament! Living Bread from Heaven.
      May our loving Jesus in the Most Blessed Sacrament be always adored. Lord
      Jesus, true God and true man, I believe that Thou art really present in
      the most Holy Eucharist, made for us a Sacred Banquet, in which the grace
      of Thy sacrifice is extended to us as token of future glory. I deeply
      adore Thee and desire to love Thee with all the warmth of my heart. With
      Thee and in union with the whole Church, I intend to give thanks to the
      Father in the Holy Spirit, for the ineffable favors that His Bounty gives
      all men in creation, especially through the Paschal mystery. Above all, I
      want to join Thee in reparation for the sins of all men, that on the cross
      Thou offered to the Father to reconcile humanity with Him. In Thy name, I
      ask the coming of the kingdom of God; that all men may know Thee, the Way,
      the Truth and the Life, and be gathered as one flock in the unity of the
      Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, loving each other as Thou loves us,
      oh Lord! Amen.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">Second Prayer</h2>
    <p class="my-4">
      With the profound respect that the same faith inspires me, oh my God and
      Savior Jesus Christ, true God and true man, I adore Thee and love Thee
      with all my heart, hidden in the Most August Sacrament of the Altar, in
      reparation for all the irreverences, desecrations and sacrileges that I
      may have committed to this day, as well as for all those done unto Thee
      and might be done to Thee in the future. I adore Thee my God, as Thou art
      worthy of being adored, and if this is not as much as I should, at least
      be it as much as I can and would like to, with that perfection of which
      all rational creatures are capable. I want to adore Thee now and always,
      not only for those Catholics that don’t adore Thee or love Thee, but as a
      supplement for all those that don’t know or love Thee, and for the
      conversion of sinners. May Jesus Christ be known, adored, loved, thanked
      in every moment, in the Most Holy and Divine Sacrament! Amen.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl text-primary font-semibold">Third Prayer</h2>
    <p class="my-4">
      To Thee Father Most Holy, through Jesus Christ Thy beloved So~ I renew the
      offering of my life to sing Thy glory and give Thee thanks for the gift of
      the presence of Thy Son in the Most Holy Sacrament and for the benefits He
      grants all humanity. I humbly ask Thee that the Holy Spirit may gather in
      unity Thy Church extended throughout the world. Strengthen in faith and
      love our Holy Father Francis, our Bishop Paul, our pastor, all clergy, our
      civil authorities and the Superiors of our Order, that their charity may
      be perfect. Have mercy on all Thy children, especially those entrusted to
      our prayers and those that contribute to the splendor of Thy worship.
      Accept our pleas, and grant us that all those of Thy children that have
      fallen away, might come back to Thee, Merciful Father, so that united may
      we form in Christ one body and one Spirit. Amen.
